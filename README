 INSTALLATION
===============

This file explains post compilation steps. It assumes that libnss-socket
is compiled and in system libraries directory (/lib).


 1. Open Unix-Domain Sockets

 2. Configure nsswitch.conf
----------------------------

The second step is to tell glibc that we use this lib. Open /etc/nsswitch.conf
and add sqlite at the end of the passwd, groups and shadow lines. You should
obtain something like :

# ...
passwd:         compat socket
group:          compat socket
shadow:         compat socket
# ...

 3. Test
